The API documentation is generated in three steps.
1. Based on the documentation for RethinkDB's JavaScript driver (available from <https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/tree/master/api/javascript>), some heuristics are automatically applied to translate examples into PHP-RQL syntax. This is done by the `jsToPhp.php` script.
2. Since some terms work differently in PHP-RQL and the automatic translation isn't perfect, a patch is applied to the result of step 1. This patch is the file `php-patches.patch`.
3. From the patched markdown file, an HTML page is generated by the script `mdToHtml.php`. This also applied a few additional filters on the markdown to account for aspects not currently supported by the PHP-RQL documentation system.

All three steps are performed automatically by the `generate.sh` script.
